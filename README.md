# Flask API SOLID Boilerplate
This repository provides a boilerplate for building a RESTful API using Flask with a focus on SOLID principles.

## Features
- Implements a basic Flask application structure for building scalable and maintainable APIs
- Integrates SOLID design principles to promote code reusability, maintainability, and testability
- Includes a sample CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API implementation to demonstrate usage
- Provides a clear directory structure and separation of concerns for easy navigation and maintenance
- Includes instructions for setting up the boilerplate and running the sample API

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required dependencies using pip or pipenv
3. Configure the environment variables and settings as needed
4. Run the Flask application and access the sample CRUD API endpoints

## Usage
- Use this boilerplate as a starting point for building Flask-based RESTful APIs
- Leverage the SOLID principles to enhance the maintainability and scalability of your API codebase
- Customize and extend the boilerplate to suit your specific project requirements
